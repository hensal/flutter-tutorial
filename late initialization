Field 'searchSnapShot' has not been initialized.:

late QuerySnapshot <Map<String, dynamic>> searchSnapShot;

ans:When you use late it means that variable can be lazily initialised, So, before use it somewhere,
 you need to Initialise thus you cannot make null checks on that,
 If you want to make null checks on it then try ? which makes that variable a nullable.

So remove late and add ?

QuerySnapshot <Map<String, dynamic>>? searchSnapShot;


question2:
late File _image;

Container(
            child: Image.file(
              _image,
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
            ),
          )

answer:
File? _image;

Container(
   child: _image != null? Image.file(
        _image,
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
            ) : const SizedBox(),
         ),
and uploadImage() if _image != null
